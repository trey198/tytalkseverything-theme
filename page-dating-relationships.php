    <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Dating Profile Coaching</h2>
    <p class="lead text-center">
      Ready for better matches and less ghosting? Your bio, your prompts, and your photos—they’re speaking before you do. 
      So if you’re not getting the kind of matches that feel good, it’s probably not you. It’s your profile’s vibe.
    </p>
    <p>
      I offer three types of coaching including a 1:1 session to help you show up clearly, confidently, and without cliché. 
      Whether you're looking for connection, chemistry, or just better conversations, your profile should reflect your actual vibe, 
      your authentic self, not a filtered version of you.
    </p>
    <p>
      This service is for people who:
      <ul>
        <li>Keep getting ghosted by matches they were excited about</li>
        <li>Feel stuck writing their bios or choosing photos</li>
        <li>Are emotionally intelligent but feel invisible online</li>
        <li>Want to attract better energy, not just more swipes</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      We audit the energy. Rebuild your bio. And get your vibe right. Because when your dating profile is in alignment with who you are, 
      it becomes a magnet, not a mask.
